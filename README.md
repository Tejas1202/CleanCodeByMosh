# CleanCodeByMosh
This repository contains all the things explained in "C# Developers: Learn The Art of Writing Clean Code" course by Mosh Hamedani

Things are been explained here by giving real life like code samples. To make the most of out this material, I've divided each class into sub-parts by #region with comments
which are as follows:
1. Code Smell/Previous Code: Indicates the existing/legacy code which has issues
2. Refactored Code: A better/clean way to write existing code
3. Supporting Code: Extra helper classes that are not changed in any of the above cases
